Just 2 applications of https://www.velove.se/containerisation-last-mile-solution :
inside fits a 1m20 x 0m80 standard EU-pallet and a height of about 1m.

Decide to go on holiday, and a few minutes later GO!, because:
A cupboard in your house has all essentials ready, and this cupboard is build as a container.
This container fits on your bike, bike-trailer, or that of a transport agency (DHL for example, who uses the Armadillo to move them)
No jamming it into suitcases, jamming those into your car, and then jamming the content into your vacation bungalow's cupboard

A bunch of free-lancers all bring their own 'fold-open office-in-container' to a flex working building, a construction site, nice spot in the park, whatever ...
Just attach power (if you don't have solar on top) and go!

If you're not a light packer, but a really heavy packer ... maybe a truck trailer as movable part of house?
Could you use one of those extendable trucks to 'just drive of' with most of your stuff and functionality, park somewhere, and make broader as humans need space.

Just some over-engineering thoughts inspired by annoyance about all the time spent (un)packing :-)
